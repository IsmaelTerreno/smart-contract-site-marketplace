# Assessment Objective related to this project
Develop a dApp (Decentralized Application) consisting of:
1. Smart Contracts: Implement a decentralized token-based marketplace.
2. Backend Service: Build a backend to interact with the smart contracts and manage EIP-712 signatures.
3. Frontend GUI: Create a simple user interface for interacting with the marketplace.

## Detailed Requirements

---

### Part 1: Smart Contracts

1. Implement a Marketplace contract using ERC-20 tokens as the traded items.
    - List Item: A user can list a certain number of ERC-20 tokens for sale at a specified price in Ether.
    - Purchase Item: Another user can purchase the listed tokens by sending the required amount of Ether. The tokens are transferred to
      the buyer.
    - Withdraw Funds: Sellers can withdraw their earnings in Ether from the marketplace contract.
2. EIP-712 Signed Message Interaction:
    - Add a function that enables token transfers based on an EIP-712 signed message:
    - Users can sign a message authorizing the marketplace to transfer tokens on their behalf.
    - The contract verifies the signature before executing the transfer.
    - Include a specific use case in the marketplace:
    - Allow sellers to pre-authorize token listings using signed messages.
3. Key Requirements:
   Use Solidity and follow EVM-compatible standards.
   Include events for important actions ( ItemListed, ItemPurchased, FundsWithdrawn).
   Use OpenZeppelin libraries such as ERC-20 where possible.

### Part 2: Backend Service

1. Build a backend service to:
    - Query listed items and purchase history from the smart contract.
    - Generate EIP-712-compliant messages for token transfers.
      Facilitate API routes for:
    - Listing items via signed messages ( POST /list).
    - Querying all items ( GET /items).
    - Purchasing item ( POST /purchase).
    - Withdraw item ( POST /withdraw)
2. Sell Tokens Directly (Optional Advanced Use Case):
   Provide an API route ( POST /sell) to:
    - Accept signed EIP-712 messages authorizing the backend to facilitate direct token transfers between users.
    - Push the transfer transaction to the blockchain on behalf of the seller and buyer.
3. Key Requirements:
    - Use Node.js with Express, Nestjs or any other equivalent framework.
    - Integrate Web3.js or ethers.js for contract interaction.
    - Include utilities for signing messages on behalf of users (e.g., using a wallet or private key during testing).

### Part 3: Frontend GUI
1. Build a simple GUI to interact with the backend and marketplace:
    - Marketplace: Display all listed ERC-20 tokens, including name, price, and quantity.
    - Listing Form: Allow users to list tokens for sale. Include an option to sign the listing with their wallet.
    - Purchase Flow: Enable users to buy tokens by connecting their wallet.
    - Withdraw Section: Allow sellers to withdraw their funds in Ether.
2. Key Requirements:
    - Use a modern frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.).
    - Implement wallet integration using MetaMask, WalletConnect, or wagmi.
    - Display detailed information about signed messages and their validation.
      Bonus (Optional)
      Add a test suite for:
    - Smart contracts (using Hardhat or Foundry).
    - EIP-712 message verification.
    - Deploy the contract to a testnet (e.g., sepolia or zkSync Era) and provide the deployment address.
    - Implement token price sorting or filtering on the frontend.
    - Add off-chain caching of marketplace data for performance (e.g., using Redis).
